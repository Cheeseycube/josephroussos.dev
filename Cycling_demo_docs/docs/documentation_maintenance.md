# Documentation Maintenance

The PCS Filter Tool Docs are built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/cli/)<br>
For help with updating the documentation see [their docs on this subject](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)<br>
To rebuild the documentation after changes are made type the following command into the terminal:<br>
```console
mkdocs build
```
